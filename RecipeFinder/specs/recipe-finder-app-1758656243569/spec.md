# Feature Specification: Recipe Finder App

## Metadata
- **Feature Branch**: feat/recipe-finder-app-1758656243569
- **Created**: 2025-09-23
- **Status**: Draft
- **Input**: Build a recipe finder app where users input ingredients and get matching recipes, using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- **Platform**: web

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Story
As a home cook, I want to input the ingredients I have available so that I can find recipes that match my available ingredients, helping me cook meals without needing to buy additional ingredients.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has ingredients available, **When** they input those ingredients into the search interface, **Then** the system should return matching recipes that can be made with those ingredients
2. **Given** a user inputs no ingredients, **When** they attempt to search, **Then** the system should display a helpful message asking them to add ingredients
3. **Given** a user inputs ingredients that have no matching recipes, **When** they search, **Then** the system should display a message suggesting similar ingredients or alternative searches
4. **Given** a user finds a recipe they like, **When** they click on it, **Then** the system should display the full recipe details including ingredients, instructions, and cooking time
5. **Given** a user wants to refine their search, **When** they add or remove ingredients, **Then** the system should update the results in real-time

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user inputs ingredients with typos or misspellings?
- How does the system handle partial ingredient matches (e.g., "tomato" vs "tomatoes")?
- What happens when a user inputs ingredients in different languages or formats?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an ingredient input interface where users can add multiple ingredients
- **FR-002**: System MUST search through a recipe database and return recipes that match the provided ingredients
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to view detailed recipe information including ingredients list, cooking instructions, and preparation time
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle ingredient matching with fuzzy search capabilities for typos and variations
- **FR-005**: System MUST display search results in a user-friendly format with recipe titles, images, and brief descriptions
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide real-time search results as users add or remove ingredients
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle cases where no recipes match the provided ingredients gracefully

### Key Entities
- **Recipe** — Contains recipe data including title, ingredients list, instructions, cooking time, difficulty level, and image
- **Ingredient** — Represents individual food items with name, category, and alternative names/variations
- **Search Query** — Contains user-provided ingredients and search parameters
- **Search Result** — Contains matched recipes with relevance scores and match details

## API Specification (API-First Approach)

### API Endpoints
- **GET /api/v1/recipes/search** — Search recipes by ingredients, parameters: ingredients (array), limit (number), offset (number), response: array of recipe objects
- **GET /api/v1/recipes/{id}** — Get detailed recipe information, parameters: recipe ID, response: complete recipe object with ingredients and instructions
- **GET /api/v1/ingredients/suggestions** — Get ingredient suggestions for autocomplete, parameters: query (string), limit (number), response: array of ingredient suggestions
- **GET /api/v1/recipes/popular** — Get popular recipes for homepage, parameters: limit (number), response: array of popular recipe objects

### API Contracts
- **Request Schema**: 
  ```json
  {
    "ingredients": ["string"],
    "limit": "number (optional, default: 20)",
    "offset": "number (optional, default: 0)"
  }

  ```
- **Error Schema**: 
  ```json
  {
    "error": "string",
    "message": "string",

### API Versioning Strategy
- **Versioning Method**: URL path versioning (/api/v1/)
- **Version Lifecycle**: Major versions supported for 2 years, deprecation notice 6 months before sunset
- **Backward Compatibility**: Non-breaking changes within major version, breaking changes require new major version
- **Migration Strategy**: Client libraries provide migration guides, API documentation includes version comparison

### API Testing Strategy
- **Contract Testing**: OpenAPI spec generates contract tests, validates request/response schemas
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end API testing with real recipe database, tests all endpoints and error scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for search endpoints, target <500ms response time for 95th percentile
- **Security Testing**: Input validation testing, CORS configuration, rate limiting validation

## Constitutional Gates

### Simplicity Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Recipe finder can be implemented with ≤5 projects:
1. Core recipe search library
2. Web UI application
3. Recipe data management
4. Search algorithm implementation
5. API layer

### Library-First Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Core functionality will be implemented as standalone libraries:
- Recipe search algorithm as independent library
- Ingredient matching logic as separate module
- Web UI as thin veneer over core libraries

### Test-First Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Test sequence planned:
1. **Contract Tests**: OpenAPI spec validation
2. **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing with real data
3. **E2E Tests**: Full user workflow testing
4. **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
5. **Implementation**: Code development

### Integration-First Testing Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Real dependencies planned:
- Real recipe database for testing
- Actual ingredient matching algorithms
- Live API endpoints for integration tests
- No mocks needed for core functionality

### Anti-Abstraction Gate

### Responsive Design Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Mobile-first responsive design:
- Mobile-first CSS approach
- Breakpoints for tablet (768px) and desktop (1024px)
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Responsive grid layout for recipe cards

### Performance Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Web performance requirements:
- <3 seconds initial page load
- <100ms interaction response time
- Core Web Vitals compliance (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1)
- Optimized images and lazy loading

### Accessibility Gate
✅ **PASSED**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance:
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast ratio ≥4.5:1
- Focus indicators and ARIA labels
- Semantic HTML structure

### Security Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Web security implementation:
- HTTPS enforcement
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- XSS protection with input sanitization
- CSRF protection for API calls
- Secure headers implementation

### Browser Compatibility Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Cross-browser support:
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility
- 95% of target browsers supported
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Feature detection for advanced capabilities

### API-First Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Web-optimized API design:
- RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- CORS configuration for web clients
- Progressive enhancement fallbacks
- OpenAPI documentation and versioning

## Quality Gates
*No quality gate violations detected*

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional gate violations - complexity tracking not needed*

## SDD Principles
- **Intent Before Mechanism**: Focus on WHAT and WHY before HOW
- **Multi-Step Refinement**: Use iterative refinement over one-shot generation
- **Library-First Testing**: Prefer real dependencies over mocks
- **CLI Interface Mandate**: Every capability has CLI with --json mode
- **Traceability**: Every line of code traces to numbered requirement
- **Business-Facing**: Specifications are for non-technical stakeholders

## Notes for Cursor
- Use absolute file paths when creating under specs/
- Use Cursor's Git UI for branch creation feat/{###-feature-slug}
- When Git isn't initialized, annotate steps and continue; avoid shell-only workflows
- Reference spec requirements in code reviews; refuse implementation tasks lacking prior tests

## SDD Version
- **Version**: SDD-Cursor-1.2
- **Generated**: 2025-09-20
- **Description**: Specification-Driven Development template based on asy-sdd.md
