## Parallelization Opportunities [P]

### Phase 1 Parallelization
- **T1.1** (Contract Tests) can run parallel with **T1.2** (Integration Tests) setup
- **T1.3** (E2E Tests) can run parallel with **T1.4** (Unit Tests) for different components
- **T1.5** (Implementation) can be parallelized across different algorithm components

### Phase 2 Parallelization
- **T2.1** (Contract Tests) can run parallel with **T2.2** (Integration Tests) setup
- **T2.3** (E2E Tests) can run parallel with **T2.4** (Unit Tests) for different endpoints
- **T2.5** (Implementation) can be parallelized across different API endpoints

### Phase 3 Parallelization
- **T3.1** (Progressive Enhancement Contract) can run parallel with **T3.6** (JS Enhancement Contract)
- **T3.2** (Progressive Enhancement Integration) can run parallel with **T3.7** (JS Enhancement Integration)
- **T3.5** (Progressive Enhancement Implementation) can run parallel with **T3.10** (JS Enhancement Implementation)

### Phase 4 Parallelization
- **T4.1** (Accessibility Contract) can run parallel with **T4.6** (Performance Contract)
