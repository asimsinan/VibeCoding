# Feature Specification: Virtual Event Organizer

## Metadata
- **Created**: 2025-01-02
- **Status**: Draft
- **Input**: Build a virtual event organizer app managing attendees, schedule, notifications, and networking, using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Firebase or Supabase (Auth, real-time DB, storage), WebSockets or Pusher for real-time features
- **Platform**: Web

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an event organizer, I want to create and manage virtual events with real-time attendee interaction, scheduling, and networking features so that I can host engaging online events that provide value to participants and facilitate meaningful connections.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am an authenticated event organizer, **When** I create a new virtual event with title, description, date/time, and capacity, **Then** the system creates the event and provides me with a shareable event link.

2. **Given** I have an active virtual event, **When** attendees register and join the event, **Then** I can see real-time attendee count, manage the participant list, and send notifications to all attendees.

3. **Given** I am managing an event schedule, **When** I add sessions with speakers, topics, and time slots, **Then** attendees receive automatic notifications about schedule changes and can view the updated agenda.

4. **Given** attendees are participating in networking features, **When** they request to connect with other participants, **Then** the system facilitates introductions and allows for private messaging between connected attendees.

5. **Given** an event is in progress, **When** I need to send announcements or updates, **Then** all attendees receive real-time notifications and can respond with feedback or questions.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the maximum attendee capacity is reached and additional people try to register?
- How does the system handle attendees who lose internet connection during the event?
- What occurs when multiple organizers try to modify the same event simultaneously?
- How does the system manage timezone differences for international attendees?
- What happens when real-time notifications fail to deliver to some attendees?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

### API Versioning Strategy

- **Versioning Method**: URL path versioning (/api/v1/, /api/v2/)
- **Version Lifecycle**: Major versions supported for 2 years, minor versions for 1 year
- **Backward Compatibility**: Non-breaking changes in minor versions, breaking changes in major versions
- **Migration Strategy**: Automated migration tools, deprecation warnings 6 months before sunset

### API Testing Strategy

- **Contract Testing**: Generated tests from OpenAPI spec using Dredd or Pact
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end API testing with real database connections
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for 1000+ concurrent users, <100ms response time
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, input validation, SQL injection prevention

## Constitutional Gates Compliance

### Simplicity Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Core functionality can be implemented with 4 projects:
1. Event Management Library (core business logic)
2. Real-time Communication Library (notifications, WebSockets)
3. Networking Library (connections, messaging)
4. Web Application (Next.js frontend with thin UI layer)

### Library-First Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Each major feature starts as a standalone library:
- Event management logic in standalone library
- Real-time communication as separate library
- Networking features as independent library
- Web app serves as thin UI veneer over core libraries

### Test-First Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Implementation sequence planned:
1. Contract tests from OpenAPI specification
2. Integration tests with real database
3. End-to-end tests for user workflows
4. Unit tests for individual components
5. Implementation following TDD principles
6. UI-API integration tests

### Integration-First Testing Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Real dependencies preferred:
- Real Firebase/Supabase database for testing
- Real WebSocket/Pusher connections for real-time features
- Real authentication providers for user testing
- Mocks only for external services (email, SMS)

### Anti-Abstraction Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Single domain model approach:
- Direct database models without DTO/Repository layers
- Event, Attendee, Session entities as primary domain models
- No unnecessary abstraction layers

### Traceability Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Every requirement mapped:
- FR-001 → Authentication tests and implementation
- FR-002 → Event creation tests and implementation
- FR-003 → Registration tests and implementation
- FR-004 → Attendee management tests and implementation
- FR-005 → Session scheduling tests and implementation
- FR-006 → Networking tests and implementation
- FR-007 → Notification tests and implementation
- FR-008 → Analytics tests and implementation

### Performance Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Web performance requirements:
- <3s initial page load time
- <100ms interaction response time
- Core Web Vitals compliance (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1)
- Progressive loading for large attendee lists

### Accessibility Gate
✅ **PASSED**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance:
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- Color contrast ratio ≥4.5:1 for normal text
- Focus indicators and skip links

### Security Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Web security implementation:
- HTTPS enforcement for all communications
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- XSS protection with input sanitization
- CSRF protection with secure tokens
- Secure authentication with JWT tokens

### Progressive Enhancement Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Graceful degradation:
- Core functionality works without JavaScript
- Event listing and basic registration without JS
- Enhanced features (real-time, networking) with JS
- Fallback notifications via email/SMS

### Responsive Design Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Mobile-first design:
- Breakpoints: mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), desktop (1024px+)
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Responsive grid layouts for event cards
- Adaptive navigation for different screen sizes

### Browser Compatibility Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Cross-browser support:
- Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Polyfills for modern JavaScript features
- CSS fallbacks for unsupported properties

### API-First Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Comprehensive API design:
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification with full documentation
- JSON responses with consistent error handling
- API versioning strategy with migration path

- ✅ Test-First approach planned (Contract → Integration → E2E → Unit → Implementation → UI-API Integration)
- ✅ Integration-First testing planned (real dependencies, justify mocks)
- ✅ Anti-Abstraction approach planned (single domain model, avoid DTO/Repository/Unit-of-Work)
- ✅ Full traceability planned (FR-XXX → tests → code)

## Execution Status
- ✅ Description parsed
- ✅ Concepts extracted
- ✅ Scenarios defined
- ✅ Requirements generated with FR-XXX numbering
- ✅ Entities identified
- ✅ Constitutional gates validated
- ✅ Review checklist passed

## SDD Principles Applied
- **Intent Before Mechanism**: Focus on WHAT (event management) and WHY (facilitate connections) before HOW (technical implementation)
- **Multi-Step Refinement**: Iterative specification development with constitutional gate validation
- **Library-First Testing**: Prefer real Firebase/Supabase dependencies over mocks
- **CLI Interface Mandate**: Developer tools will have CLI with --json mode for automation
- **Traceability**: Every line of code traces to numbered requirements (FR-001 through FR-008)
- **Business-Facing**: Specification written for event organizers and stakeholders, not just developers

## SDD Version
- **Version**: SDD-Cursor-1.2
- **Generated**: 2025-01-02
- **Description**: Specification-Driven Development template based on comprehensive event management requirements
