# Feature Specification: Mental Health Journal App

## Metadata
- **Created**: 2025-01-28
- **Status**: Draft
- **Input**: Create a mental health journal app where users log mood daily and view trend charts, using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind
- **Platform**: Web

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a person interested in tracking my mental health, I want to log my daily mood and view trend charts so that I can better understand my emotional patterns and make informed decisions about my well-being.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am a new user visiting the app, **When** I open the application, **Then** I should see a clean, accessible interface with options to log my mood and view my mood history.

2. **Given** I want to log my mood for today, **When** I select a mood rating and optionally add notes, **Then** the system should save my entry and confirm the successful logging.

3. **Given** I have logged multiple mood entries, **When** I navigate to the trends view, **Then** I should see interactive charts showing my mood patterns over time with different time periods (week, month, year).

4. **Given** I want to edit a previous mood entry, **When** I select an existing entry and modify it, **Then** the system should update the entry and reflect the changes in all views.

5. **Given** I want to delete a mood entry, **When** I confirm the deletion, **Then** the system should remove the entry and update all related charts and statistics.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to log multiple mood entries for the same day?
- How does the system handle users who haven't logged any mood data yet?
- What happens when the user's device loses internet connection while logging mood?
- How does the system handle very old mood entries when generating trend charts?
- What happens when a user tries to access the app with JavaScript disabled?

## Requirements

### API Versioning Strategy

- **Versioning Method**: URL path versioning (/api/v1/)
- **Version Lifecycle**: Major versions supported for 2 years, minor versions for 6 months
- **Backward Compatibility**: Non-breaking changes only within major versions
- **Migration Strategy**: Automated migration tools and deprecation warnings 6 months before removal

### API Testing Strategy

- **Contract Testing**: Generated tests from OpenAPI specification using Dredd or similar tools
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end API testing with real database connections
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for 100 concurrent users with <500ms response times
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, input validation, and XSS/CSRF protection testing

## Constitutional Gates Validation

### Simplicity Gate
✅ **PASSED**: The mental health journal app can be implemented with ≤5 projects:
1. Core mood logging library
2. Chart visualization library  
3. Data persistence layer
4. Next.js web application
5. API layer for cloud sync

### Library-First Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Core functionality will be implemented as standalone libraries:
- Mood tracking logic as independent library
- Chart generation as separate visualization library
- Data models as shared library
- Next.js app serves as thin UI veneer over libraries

### Test-First Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Implementation will follow TDD sequence:
1. Contract tests (API specifications)
2. Integration tests (database interactions)
3. E2E tests (user workflows)
4. Unit tests (individual functions)
5. Implementation (minimal code to pass tests)
6. UI-API integration tests

### Integration-First Testing Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Will use real dependencies:
- Real IndexedDB for local storage testing
- Real PostgreSQL for cloud sync testing
- Real Chart.js for visualization testing
- Mocks only justified for external API rate limits

### Anti-Abstraction Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Single domain model approach:
- One MoodEntry model for all operations
- Direct data access without Repository pattern
- Simple service layer without Unit-of-Work abstraction

### Traceability Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Every code line will trace to requirements:
- FR-001 → mood logging interface tests and implementation
- FR-002 → notes functionality tests and implementation
- FR-003 → history view tests and implementation
- FR-004 → chart generation tests and implementation
- FR-005 → edit/delete tests and implementation
- FR-006 → responsive design tests and implementation
- FR-007 → data storage tests and implementation

### Performance Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Web performance requirements met:
- <3s initial page load time
- <100ms interaction response time
- Core Web Vitals optimization
- Lazy loading for chart components

### Accessibility Gate
✅ **PASSED**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance planned:
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support with proper ARIA labels
- Color contrast ratio ≥4.5:1
- Focus indicators and skip links

### Security Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Web security measures planned:
- HTTPS enforcement for all connections
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- XSS protection with input sanitization
- CSRF protection for API endpoints

### Progressive Enhancement Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Graceful degradation planned:
- Basic mood logging works without JavaScript
- Charts enhance with JavaScript enabled
- Form submissions work with standard HTML
- Fallback to server-side rendering

### Responsive Design Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Mobile-first design planned:
- Breakpoints: mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), desktop (1024px+)
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Scalable chart components
- Flexible grid layouts

### Browser Compatibility Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Cross-browser support planned:
- Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Polyfills for modern JavaScript features
- CSS fallbacks for unsupported properties

### API-First Gate
✅ **PASSED**: Web-optimized APIs planned:
- RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- CORS support for cross-origin requests
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Progressive enhancement fallbacks

- ✅ Test-First approach planned (Contract → Integration → E2E → Unit → Implementation → UI-API Integration)
- ✅ Integration-First testing planned (real dependencies, justify mocks)
- ✅ Anti-Abstraction approach planned (single domain model, avoid DTO/Repository/Unit-of-Work)
- ✅ Full traceability planned (FR-XXX → tests → code)

## Execution Status

- ✅ Description parsed
- ✅ Concepts extracted
- ✅ Scenarios defined
- ✅ Requirements generated with FR-XXX numbering
- ✅ Entities identified
- ✅ Constitutional gates validated
- ✅ Review checklist passed

## Complexity Tracking

No constitutional gates were violated in this specification. All gates passed validation with the planned approach.

## SDD Principles

- **Intent Before Mechanism**: Focus on user value (mood tracking and insights) before technical implementation
- **Multi-Step Refinement**: Iterative development with test-driven approach
- **Library-First Testing**: Real dependencies for data storage and chart generation
- **CLI Interface Mandate**: API endpoints support programmatic access with JSON responses
- **Traceability**: Every feature maps to numbered requirements (FR-001 through FR-007)
- **Business Facing**: Specification focuses on user benefits and mental health outcomes
