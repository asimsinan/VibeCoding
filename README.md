# Vibe Coding Challenge with SDD-MCP

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

Welcome to the **Vibe Coding Challenge** using the **Specification-Driven Development (SDD-MCP)** tool! This challenge demonstrates how AI can build complete, production-ready applications following rigorous software engineering principles.

## 🛠️ What is SDD-MCP?

**SDD-MCP** (Specification-Driven Development - Model Context Protocol) is a revolutionary development methodology that enforces:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with strict ordering: Contract → Integration → E2E → Unit → Implementation
- **Constitutional Gates** that prevent over-engineering and ensure quality
- **Library-First Architecture** with thin UI veneers
- **Progressive Enhancement** for web applications
- **Full Traceability** from requirements to code
- **Integration-First Testing** with real dependencies

## 📋 Challenge Structure

### [Week 1: Recipe Finder App](./RecipeFinder/)
**Prompt**: *"Build a recipe finder app where users input ingredients and get matching recipes, using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript"*

### Future Weeks
The difficulty will gradually increase with more complex prompts and requirements.


## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This challenge demonstrates:

1. **Specification-Driven Development**: How to build from requirements
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests before implementation
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Building for all users and devices
4. **API-First Design**: Building robust, testable APIs
5. **Quality Engineering**: Constitutional gates and best practices
6. **Full-Stack Development**: Complete application architecture

## 🔮 Future Challenges

The difficulty will increase with:

- **Week 2**: Multi-user features, authentication, real-time updates
- **Week 3**: Advanced algorithms, machine learning integration
- **Week 4**: Microservices architecture, distributed systems
- **Week 5**: Mobile app development, cross-platform solutions
