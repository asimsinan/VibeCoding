# Vibe Coding Challenge with SDD-MCP

## üéØ Challenge Overview

Welcome to the **Vibe Coding Challenge** using the **Specification-Driven Development (SDD-MCP)** tool! This challenge demonstrates how AI can build complete, production-ready applications following rigorous software engineering principles.

## üõ†Ô∏è What is SDD-MCP?

**SDD-MCP** (Specification-Driven Development - Model Context Protocol) is a revolutionary development methodology that enforces:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with strict ordering: Contract ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí E2E ‚Üí Unit ‚Üí Implementation
- **Constitutional Gates** that prevent over-engineering and ensure quality
- **Library-First Architecture** with thin UI veneers
- **Progressive Enhancement** for web applications
- **Full Traceability** from requirements to code
- **Integration-First Testing** with real dependencies

## üìã Challenge Structure

### [Challenge 1: Recipe Finder](./RecipeFinder/) (Built in 3 hours)
**Prompt**: *"Build a recipe finder app where users input ingredients and get matching recipes, using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript"*

### [Challenge 2: Invoce Generator](./InvoiceGenerator/) (Built in 5.5 hours)
**Prompt**: *"Build an invoice generator that lets users enter client details and items and download as PDF, using React, CSS, and jsPDF."*

### [Challenge 3: Appointment Scheduler](./AppointmentScheduler/) (Built in 3.5 hours)
**Prompt**: *"Build a personal finance dasboard to track spending categories and visualize with charts using React, Typescript, Tailwind, Chartjs."*

### [Challenge 4: Personal Finance Dashboard](./PersonalFinanceDashBoard) (Built in 3 hours)
**Prompt**: *"Create an appointment scheduler with a calendar view and booking slots, using React, Tailwind CSS, and date-handling library like date-fns"*
### [Challenge 5: Mental Health Journal](./MentalHealthJournal) (Built in 3.5 hours)
**Prompt**: *"Create a mental health journal app where users log mood daily and view trend charts, using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind"*
### [Challenge 6: Personal Shopping Assistant](./PersonalShoppingAssistant) (Built in 4.5 hours)
**Prompt**: *"Prompt: Create a virtual personal shopping assistant that suggests products based on user preferences, using React, TypeScript, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL, and a simple recommendation algorithm"*
### [Challenge 7: Market Place](./MarketPlace) (Built in 4.5 hours)
**Prompt**: *"Prompt: Create a marketplace app where users list items and allow browsing/purchase, using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Node.js backend, Stripe, and PostgreSQL or MongoDB."*

### Future Challenges
The difficulty will gradually increase with more complex prompts and requirements.
