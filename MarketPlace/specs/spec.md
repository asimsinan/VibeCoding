# Feature Specification: marketplace-app

## Metadata
- **Created**: 2025-01-30
- **Status**: Draft
- **Platform**: Web
- **Input**: Create a marketplace app where users list items and allow browsing/purchase, using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Node.js backend, Stripe, and PostgreSQL or MongoDB

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a marketplace user, I want to browse, search, and purchase items from other users, and also list my own items for sale, so that I can participate in a peer-to-peer marketplace ecosystem where I can both buy and sell goods efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am a new user visiting the marketplace, **When** I access the homepage, **Then** I should see featured items, categories, and search functionality without requiring authentication.

2. **Given** I want to purchase an item, **When** I click on a product listing, **Then** I should see detailed product information, seller details, and a secure checkout process with Stripe integration.

3. **Given** I am a registered user, **When** I want to list an item for sale, **Then** I should be able to upload photos, set price, add description, and publish the listing with proper validation.

4. **Given** I am browsing items, **When** I use search or filter functionality, **Then** I should see relevant results with proper pagination and sorting options.

5. **Given** I complete a purchase, **When** the payment is processed, **Then** both buyer and seller should receive confirmation notifications and the item should be marked as sold.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to purchase an item that was just sold by another user?
- How does the system handle payment failures or Stripe API errors during checkout?
- What occurs when a seller tries to list an item with invalid or inappropriate content?
- How does the system handle concurrent users trying to purchase the same limited-quantity item?
- What happens when database connections fail during critical operations like payment processing?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide user authentication and registration with secure password handling
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to create, edit, and delete product listings with image uploads
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to browse, search, and filter products by category, price, and location
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate with Stripe for secure payment processing and transaction management
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time notifications for purchase confirmations and listing updates
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain user profiles with purchase history and seller ratings

### API Versioning Strategy

- **Versioning Method**: URL path versioning (/api/v1/, /api/v2/)
- **Version Lifecycle**: 12-month deprecation notice for major versions
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility for at least 6 months
- **Migration Strategy**: Gradual migration with client SDK updates and documentation

### API Testing Strategy

- **Contract Testing**: Generated tests from OpenAPI specification
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end API testing with real database
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for 1000+ concurrent users
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, and input validation testing

## Constitutional Gates Compliance
