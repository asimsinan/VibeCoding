# Phase 3 Implementation Plan: PersonalFinanceDashboard

## Metadata
*   **Feature Branch**: feat/personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386
*   **Generated**: 2025-09-26
*   **Status**: Draft
*   **Platform**: web
*   **Feature ID**: personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386

## Phase Overview
Phase 3, "Data Models," focuses on defining the core data structures for the application and creating the corresponding unit tests. This phase is crucial for ensuring data integrity and consistency across the frontend and backend. It strictly adheres to the "Test-First" principle of TDD, ensuring that tests are written and are failing before the data models are fully implemented.

## Phase 3 Tasks

### TASK-007: Create Data Models (FR-002)
*   **Description**: Create TypeScript interfaces/types from the finalized API contracts for both frontend and backend to represent `Transaction`, `Category`, and `User` entities.
*   **TDD Phase**: Contract
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: TypeScript interfaces/types are defined accurately and reflect the database schema and API contracts.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 100-150 lines (TypeScript)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-005"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: Anti-Abstraction Gate, Library-First Gate, Traceability Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**: This task involves translating the schema design from Phase 2 and the API contracts from Phase 1 into concrete TypeScript interfaces. These interfaces will serve as the blueprint for data structures throughout the application, ensuring type safety and consistency.

### TASK-008: Create Model Tests (FR-002)
*   **Description**: Write unit tests for data models to ensure data integrity, validation rules, and proper instantiation. These tests will initially fail until models are implemented.
*   **TDD Phase**: Unit
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Unit tests for data models are implemented and executable, failing initially.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 150-250 lines (TypeScript/Jest)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-007"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: Test-First Gate, Library-First Gate, Traceability Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**: These tests will validate the behavior of the data models, including any default values, derived properties, and basic validation rules. They will be written using a unit testing framework (e.g., Jest) and will focus on the individual models in isolation.

## Constitutional Gates Re-validation
*   **Test-First Gate**: This phase reinforces the Test-First Gate by requiring unit tests for data models to be written before their full implementation.
*   **Anti-Abstraction Gate**: The creation of a single set of data models (`Transaction`, `Category`, `User`) for both frontend and backend directly aligns with the Anti-Abstraction Gate.
*   **Library-First Gate**: The data models will be defined within the `lib/finance-tracker/models/` directory, adhering to the Library-First Gate.
*   **Traceability Gate**: All tasks explicitly link back to `FR-XXX` requirements, maintaining traceability.

## Next Steps
Upon completion of Phase 3, the development team will have well-defined, testable data models, ready to proceed with the core library implementation in Phase 4, which will involve writing business logic that utilizes these models.
