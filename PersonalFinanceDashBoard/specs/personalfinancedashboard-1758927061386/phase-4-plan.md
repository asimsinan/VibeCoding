## Metadata
*   **Feature Branch**: feat/personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386
*   **Generated**: 2025-09-26
*   **Status**: Draft
*   **Platform**: web
*   **Feature ID**: personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386

## Phase Overview
Phase 4, "Library Implementation," focuses on building the core business logic of the financial tracking and categorization features. This phase adheres strictly to Test-Driven Development (TDD), meaning that implementation will be guided by existing integration and unit tests, and new tests will be written as needed. The goal is to encapsulate the core functionalities within reusable library services and expose them via a CLI interface.

## Phase 4 Tasks

### TASK-009: Implement Core Library (FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, FR-004, FR-005)
*   **Description**: Implement the core business logic for financial tracking and categorization within `lib/finance-tracker/services/` (e.g., `TransactionService`, `CategoryService`), adhering to TDD. Includes CRUD operations and data aggregation.
*   **TDD Phase**: Implementation
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Core library services are implemented, passing all associated unit and integration tests.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 800-1200 lines (TypeScript)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-002", "TASK-007", "TASK-008"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: Library-First Gate, Anti-Abstraction Gate, Test-First Gate, Traceability Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**: This task will involve creating concrete service classes (e.g., `TransactionService`, `CategoryService`) that interact with the database using Knex.js. These services will implement the CRUD operations for transactions and categories, and also handle data aggregation logic for the dashboard summary. The implementation will be driven by the failing integration and unit tests already created in Phase 1 and Phase 3.

### TASK-010: Create CLI Interface (FR-005)
*   **Description**: Develop `lib/finance-tracker/cli.ts` to expose key functionalities for managing categories and potentially importing initial data, with `--json` mode support.
*   **TDD Phase**: Implementation
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: CLI interface is functional and documented, allowing programmatic interaction with the finance tracker library.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 100-200 lines (TypeScript)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-009"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: CLI Interface Gate, Library-First Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**: This task will build a command-line interface around the core library services implemented in TASK-009. It will enable users to interact with the finance tracker functionality directly from the terminal, supporting operations like adding/listing categories and potentially importing data from external sources. The `--json` mode will be crucial for scripting and integration with other tools.

### TASK-011: Library Integration Tests (FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, FR-004, FR-005)
*   **Description**: Write additional integration tests for the `lib/finance-tracker/` services, ensuring proper interaction with the PostgreSQL database. These tests will pass after `TASK-009` is complete.
*   **TDD Phase**: Integration Tests
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Integration test suite passes, validating the library's interaction with the database.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 200-300 lines (TypeScript/Supertest)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-009"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: Integration-First Testing Gate, Test-First Gate, Traceability Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**: These integration tests will specifically target the `lib/finance-tracker/` services to verify their interaction with the PostgreSQL database. They will cover scenarios involving data persistence, retrieval, and complex queries, ensuring the services correctly handle database operations. These tests are expected to pass once TASK-009 is fully implemented.

## Constitutional Gates Re-validation
*   **Library-First Gate**: This entire phase is dedicated to building the core business logic within `lib/finance-tracker/`, reinforcing the Library-First Gate.
*   **Anti-Abstraction Gate**: The focus on direct implementation within services, without unnecessary layers, aligns with the Anti-Abstraction Gate.
*   **Test-First Gate**: All implementation (TASK-009) is driven by tests, and additional integration tests (TASK-011) are an integral part of this phase, upholding the Test-First Gate.
*   **CLI Interface Gate**: The creation of a CLI (TASK-010) directly addresses the CLI Interface Gate.
*   **Traceability Gate**: All tasks explicitly link back to `FR-XXX` requirements, maintaining traceability.
*   **Integration-First Testing Gate**: TASK-011 emphasizes writing integration tests that interact with the real PostgreSQL database.

## Next Steps
Upon completion of Phase 4, the core business logic of the Personal Finance Dashboard will be implemented and thoroughly tested, along with a functional CLI. This will provide a solid foundation for the application layer in Phase 5: Application Integration.
