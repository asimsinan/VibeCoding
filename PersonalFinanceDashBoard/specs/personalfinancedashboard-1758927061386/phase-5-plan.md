# Phase 5 Implementation Plan: PersonalFinanceDashboard

## Metadata
*   **Feature Branch**: feat/personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386
*   **Generated**: 2025-09-26
*   **Status**: Draft
*   **Platform**: web
*   **Feature ID**: personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386
*   **Phase**: 5: Application Integration

## Phase Overview
Phase 5 focuses on the core application integration, bridging the gap between the implemented `finance-tracker` library and the API layer, and setting up the foundational frontend structure. This phase includes implementing the backend API controllers to handle requests, interact with the core library, and manage authentication. Concurrently, the foundational React components for the frontend will be developed, establishing the layout, navigation, and state management required for the user interface.

## Tasks

### TASK-012: Backend API Implementation (FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, FR-004, FR-005)
*   **Description**: Implement controller logic in `api/controllers/` to handle API requests, interact with `lib/finance-tracker/` and `lib/auth/`, and manage user authentication via JWTs.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: All API endpoints are implemented and fully functional, passing all contract and integration tests.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 400-600 lines (TypeScript/Express)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-010", "TASK-011"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: API-First Gate, Security Gate, Simplicity Gate, Traceability Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**:
    *   Develop API routes and corresponding controller functions.
    *   Integrate `TransactionService` and `CategoryService` from the `lib/finance-tracker/` library.
    *   Implement JWT-based authentication middleware to secure endpoints.
    *   Ensure proper request validation and error handling as defined in the API contracts.
    *   Focus on adhering to the OpenAPI specification for all request and response structures.

### TASK-013: Frontend Core Application Structure (FR-006)
*   **Description**: Develop foundational React components (`web/components/`) for layout, navigation, and state management (e.g., React Context or Zustand).
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Basic frontend application structure is in place with routing, global state management, and reusable UI components.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 300-500 lines (TypeScript/React/Tailwind)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-012"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: Responsive Design Gate, Progressive Enhancement Gate, Simplicity Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**:
    *   Set up React application boilerplate, including routing (e.g., React Router).
    *   Create core layout components (e.g., Header, Sidebar, Footer, MainContent).
    *   Implement global state management for user authentication status and potentially other shared data.
    *   Develop initial reusable UI components (e.g., Button, Input, Card) using Tailwind CSS for styling.
    *   Ensure the structure supports responsive design principles and progressive enhancement for future UI development.

## Implementation Workflow (TDD)
1.  **Review Dependencies**: Ensure `TASK-010` (CLI Interface) and `TASK-011` (Library Integration Tests) are completed and passed before starting `TASK-012`.
2.  **Start TASK-012 (Backend API Implementation)**:
    *   **Write Failing Tests**: Develop new integration tests (`tests/integration/api/`) for each API endpoint that will be implemented, based on the OpenAPI contract. These tests should initially fail.
    *   **Implement Minimal Code**: Write the necessary controller logic and API routes in `src/api/controllers/` to make the integration tests pass.
    *   **Refactor**: Improve code quality, ensure error handling, and optimize performance while keeping tests green.
3.  **Start TASK-013 (Frontend Core Application Structure)**:
    *   **Planning & Design**: Outline the component hierarchy and state management strategy. No failing tests are strictly required at this stage for the structure itself, but component-level unit tests can be introduced for complex components.
    *   **Implement Structure**: Develop the foundational React components, set up routing, and integrate state management.
    *   **Verify**: Manually verify the frontend structure and navigation in the browser. Add unit tests for individual complex components as needed.

## Definition of Done for Phase 5
*   All tasks in Phase 5 are completed.
*   `TASK-012` has all associated contract and integration tests passing.
*   Backend API endpoints are fully functional and adhere to the OpenAPI specification.
*   `TASK-013` has a robust and well-structured frontend application with basic routing and state management in place.
*   Code written is reviewed, lint-free, and adheres to project standards.
*   All constitutional gates are respected.
*   Traceability to Functional Requirements (FR-XXX) is maintained.
