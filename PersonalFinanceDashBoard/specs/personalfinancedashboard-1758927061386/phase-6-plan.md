# Phase 6 Implementation Plan: UI-API Integration

## Feature Details
*   **Feature Branch**: feat/personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386
*   **Feature ID**: personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386
*   **Phase**: 6
*   **Phase Description**: UI-API Integration (CRITICAL) - Connect UI to APIs, a crucial step often missed in API-First development.
*   **Platform**: web
*   **Generated**: 2025-09-27

## Phase Overview
This phase focuses on the critical integration between the frontend UI and the backend APIs. It involves setting up a robust API client, implementing data fetching and display logic in React components, developing UI for transaction and category management, and creating comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) tests to validate the complete user flows.

## Tasks

### TASK-014: API Client Setup (FR-001, FR-003, FR-004, FR-005)
*   **Description**: Set up an API client (e.g., Axios instance) in the frontend for making requests to the backend API, including authentication headers and error handling.
*   **TDD Phase**: UI-API Integration (Setup)
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: A robust API client is configured, capable of sending authenticated requests and handling API responses/errors.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 100-150 lines (TypeScript/Axios)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-001", "TASK-002"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: API-First Gate, Security Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**:
    *   Use Axios for HTTP requests due to its widespread adoption and good features for interceptors and error handling.
    *   Implement Axios interceptors for automatically attaching JWT tokens for authenticated requests.
    *   Standardize error response handling to provide meaningful feedback to the user.
    *   Consider a base URL configuration that can be easily switched between development and production environments.

### TASK-015: Frontend Data Fetching & Display (FR-003, FR-004)
*   **Description**: Implement data fetching logic in frontend components using the API client to retrieve transactions, categories, and dashboard summary data. Display this data using React components and Chart.js.
*   **TDD Phase**: UI-API Integration (Data Fetching)
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Dashboard displays real data from the API, and charts render correctly based on fetched data.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 400-600 lines (TypeScript/React/Chart.js)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-014"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: Progressive Enhancement Gate, Performance Gate, Accessibility Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**:
    *   Utilize React Query or a similar library for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management, providing better UX with loading and error states.
    *   Integrate Chart.js for visualizing financial data on the dashboard (e.g., expense trends, category breakdowns).
    *   Design reusable React components for displaying lists of transactions and categories.
    *   Ensure proper loading indicators and error messages are displayed while data is being fetched or if an error occurs.

### TASK-016: Frontend Transaction/Category Management UI (FR-001, FR-005)
*   **Description**: Develop UI for adding new transactions, defining new categories, and editing/deleting existing ones.
*   **TDD Phase**: UI-API Integration (UI Development)
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: User can successfully create, edit, and delete transactions and categories through the UI, with changes reflected in the dashboard.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 300-500 lines (TypeScript/React/Tailwind)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-015"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: Responsive Design Gate, Accessibility Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**:
    *   Create forms for adding and editing transactions and categories.
    *   Implement confirmation dialogs for delete operations to prevent accidental data loss.
    *   Ensure input validation on the client-side for a better user experience.
    *   Use Tailwind CSS for styling to maintain a consistent and responsive design.

### TASK-017: Frontend UI-API Integration Tests (FR-001, FR-003, FR-004, FR-005, FR-006)
*   **Description**: Write end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress to validate the complete user flows, including UI interactions, API calls, and data display.
*   **TDD Phase**: E2E Tests
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: E2E tests pass for critical user journeys, ensuring seamless UI-API integration and correct functionality.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 500-800 lines (JavaScript/Cypress)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-016"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: E2E Testing, Traceability Gate, Browser Compatibility Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**:
    *   Set up Cypress for end-to-end testing, covering user login, navigation, transaction/category creation, editing, deletion, and dashboard data display.
    *   Simulate user interactions and assert on UI changes and API responses.
    *   Ensure tests cover various scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.
    *   Integrate Cypress with the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing.
