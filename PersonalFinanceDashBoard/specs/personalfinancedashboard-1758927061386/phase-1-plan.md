## Metadata
*   **Feature Branch**: feat/personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386
*   **Generated**: 2025-09-26
*   **Status**: Draft
*   **Platform**: web
*   **Feature ID**: personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386

## Phase Overview
Phase 1, "Contract & Test Setup," focuses on establishing the foundational contracts and initial test suites for the Personal Finance Dashboard. This includes defining the OpenAPI specification for the API, creating data models, and setting up the initial contract and integration tests. This phase strictly adheres to the "Test-First" principle of TDD, ensuring that tests are written and are failing before any significant implementation begins.

## Phase 1 Tasks

### TASK-001: Create API Contracts (FR-001, FR-003, FR-004, FR-005)
*   **Description**: Finalize OpenAPI 3.0 specification (`contracts/openapi.yaml`) for all transaction, category, and dashboard summary endpoints. Define request/response schemas, data types, validation rules, and error handling.
*   **TDD Phase**: Contract
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Comprehensive `openapi.yaml` file exists, defining all API endpoints, schemas, and error responses.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 300-500 lines (YAML)
*   **Dependencies**: []
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: API-First Gate, Traceability Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**: This task is crucial for establishing a clear contract between the frontend and backend. It will involve detailed review of the functional requirements (FR-XXX) to accurately define all API endpoints and their associated data structures. The generated `openapi.yaml` will be the single source of truth for API definitions.

### TASK-002: Create Contract Tests (FR-001, FR-003, FR-004, FR-005)
*   **Description**: Write initial contract tests based on the OpenAPI specification using a tool like Dredd or custom scripts to ensure API adherence. These tests will initially fail.
*   **TDD Phase**: Contract
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Contract test suite is implemented and executable, failing as expected before API implementation.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 200-400 lines (TypeScript/JavaScript)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-001"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: Test-First Gate, Integration-First Testing Gate, Traceability Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**: These tests will be written directly against the `openapi.yaml` to verify that the API implementation (when it exists) conforms to the defined contract. It's expected that these tests will fail at this stage, serving as a clear indicator for future development.

### TASK-003: Create Integration Test Scenarios (FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, FR-004, FR-005)
*   **Description**: Outline integration test scenarios for backend API endpoints, focusing on database interactions (CRUD for transactions and categories, data aggregation for summary). These tests will initially fail.
*   **TDD Phase**: Integration
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Detailed integration test suite (using Supertest) outlining various scenarios for backend services, failing initially.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 300-500 lines (TypeScript/JavaScript)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-001"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: Test-First Gate, Integration-First Testing Gate, Traceability Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**: These tests will focus on the interactions between the API and the database. They will be designed to cover the full lifecycle of data (create, read, update, delete) for transactions and categories, as well as complex queries for dashboard summaries. They are expected to fail initially as the backend services are not yet implemented.

## Constitutional Gates Re-validation
*   **Test-First Gate**: This phase directly enforces the Test-First Gate by mandating the creation of failing tests before any implementation.
*   **Integration-First Testing Gate**: The focus on integration test scenarios that interact with a real database (even if the database is not yet fully populated) directly supports the Integration-First Testing Gate.
*   **API-First Gate**: TASK-001 is a direct implementation of the API-First Gate, ensuring API contracts are defined upfront.
*   **Traceability Gate**: All tasks explicitly link back to `FR-XXX` requirements, maintaining traceability.

## Next Steps
Upon completion of Phase 1, the development team will have a robust set of failing tests and a clear API contract, ready to proceed with database setup and core library implementation in subsequent phases.
