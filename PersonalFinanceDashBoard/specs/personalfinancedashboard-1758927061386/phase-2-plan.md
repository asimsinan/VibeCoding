*   **Feature ID**: personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386

## Phase Overview
Phase 2, "Database Setup," focuses on establishing the PostgreSQL database, designing its schema, and setting up a migration system. This foundational phase ensures that the application has a robust and evolvable data storage layer. It emphasizes the "Database Gate" and "Simplicity Gate" by promoting a well-configured and manageable database environment.

## Phase 2 Tasks

### TASK-004: Database Setup (FR-002)
*   **Description**: Set up PostgreSQL database, including user creation and basic configuration.
*   **TDD Phase**: Implementation (Pre-Unit/Integration Tests)
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: PostgreSQL database instance is accessible and configured for the application.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 50-100 lines (SQL/Shell)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-001"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: Database Gate, Security Gate, Simplicity Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**: This task involves installing PostgreSQL, creating a dedicated database and user for the application, and configuring basic permissions. It will likely involve running shell commands and SQL scripts.

### TASK-005: Schema Design (FR-002)
*   **Description**: Design enterprise-grade schema for `users`, `categories`, and `transactions` tables, including relationships, indexes, constraints, and data types.
*   **TDD Phase**: Implementation (Pre-Unit/Integration Tests)
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Detailed SQL schema definition for all tables, including primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 100-200 lines (SQL)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-004"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: Database Gate, Anti-Abstraction Gate, Traceability Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**: This task will involve writing SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) statements to create the necessary tables, define their columns with appropriate data types, establish primary and foreign key relationships, and add indexes for performance optimization.

### TASK-006: Migration Setup (FR-002)
*   **Description**: Plan and set up database migrations using a tool (e.g., Flyway or Knex.js) to manage schema evolution.
*   **TDD Phase**: Implementation (Pre-Unit/Integration Tests)
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Migration tool is configured, and initial migration script reflects the schema design.
*   **Estimated LOC**: 50-100 lines (TypeScript/JavaScript/Configuration)
*   **Dependencies**: ["TASK-005"]
*   **Constitutional Compliance**: Database Gate, Simplicity Gate
*   **Implementation Insights**: This task will involve choosing a migration tool (e.g., Knex.js for a TypeScript/JavaScript project), configuring it to connect to the PostgreSQL database, and creating the initial migration script that applies the schema designed in TASK-005.

## Constitutional Gates Re-validation
*   **Database Gate**: This phase is entirely focused on establishing a robust database, directly fulfilling the Database Gate.
*   **Security Gate**: User creation and basic configuration in TASK-004 contribute to the Security Gate by ensuring proper database access control.
*   **Simplicity Gate**: Using a migration tool simplifies schema evolution, aligning with the Simplicity Gate.
*   **Anti-Abstraction Gate**: Designing a clear and direct schema for `users`, `categories`, and `transactions` without unnecessary layers adheres to the Anti-Abstraction Gate.
*   **Traceability Gate**: All tasks explicitly link back to `FR-XXX` requirements, maintaining traceability.

## Next Steps
Upon completion of Phase 2, the development team will have a fully set up and schema-initialized PostgreSQL database, ready for the data modeling and unit testing tasks in Phase 3.
