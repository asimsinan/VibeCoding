# Feature Specification: PersonalFinanceDashboard

## Metadata
*   **Feature Branch**: feat/personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386
*   **Created**: 2025-09-26
*   **Status**: Draft
*   **Input**: Build a personal finance dashboard to track spending categories and visualize with charts, using React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Chart.js
*   **Platform**: web

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want a personal finance dashboard that allows me to easily track my spending across different categories and visualize this data using interactive charts, so I can better understand my financial habits and make informed decisions to manage my money effectively.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** I have entered multiple transactions with different categories, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I should see a clear breakdown of my spending by category in a chart.
2.  **Given** I navigate to the dashboard, **When** no transaction data is available, **Then** I should see a message indicating no data and guidance on how to add transactions.
3.  **Given** I am viewing spending by category, **When** I filter the data by a specific date range, **Then** the charts should update dynamically to reflect spending within that period.

### Edge Cases
*   What happens when a user enters a transaction without assigning a category? The system should default to an "Uncategorized" category or prompt the user to assign one.
*   How does the system handle extremely large numbers of transactions? The system should efficiently aggregate data for charting and provide pagination or infinite scrolling for transaction lists.
*   What if a chart has too many categories to display clearly? The system should group smaller categories into an "Other" category or allow users to focus on top categories.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
*   **FR-001**: The system MUST allow users to input new financial transactions, including amount, date, description, and category.
*   **FR-002**: The system MUST store transaction data securely and associate it with a user.
*   **FR-003**: The system MUST display a summary of spending by category using interactive charts (e.g., pie charts, bar charts).
*   **FR-004**: The system MUST allow users to view transactions and spending summaries over customizable date ranges.
*   **FR-005**: The system MUST provide a mechanism for users to define and manage custom spending categories.
*   **FR-006**: The system MUST present a responsive user interface that adapts to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
*   **FR-007**: The system MUST use Chart.js for all data visualizations.

### Key Entities
*   **Transaction** — Represents a single financial event with attributes like `id`, `userId`, `amount`, `type` (income/expense), `date`, `description`, `categoryId`.
*   **Category** — Defines a spending or income category with attributes like `id`, `userId`, `name`, `type`.
*   **User** — Represents a user of the dashboard with attributes like `id`, `username`, `email`, `passwordHash`.

### Database Requirements
*   **Database Type**: PostgreSQL, due to its strong support for relational data, ACID compliance, and suitability for structured financial data with complex queries.
*   **Data Volume**: Expected to start with hundreds of records per user, potentially growing to thousands over time. Growth rate dependent on user activity.
*   **Performance**: Transaction and category data retrieval for dashboard display must be <100ms. Aggregated reports should load within 2-3 seconds for common date ranges.
*   **Consistency**: ACID compliance is crucial for financial data integrity.
*   **Security**: All sensitive data (e.g., transaction amounts, user details) must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Implement robust access control based on user IDs.
*   **Scalability**: Designed for vertical scaling initially, with horizontal scaling considerations (read replicas, sharding) for future growth if needed.
*   **Backup/Recovery**: Daily backups with a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 24 hours and a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 4 hours.

## API Specification (API-First Approach)

### API Endpoints
*   **POST /api/v1/transactions** — Create a new transaction.
    *   Parameters: `userId` (auth token), `amount`, `type`, `date`, `description`, `categoryId`.

    *   Parameters: `startDate`, `endDate`, `categoryId` (optional), `limit`, `offset`.
    *   Response: `200 OK` with an array of transaction objects.
*   **PUT /api/v1/transactions/{id}** — Update an existing transaction.
    *   Parameters: `id` (path), `userId` (auth token), `amount` (optional), `type` (optional), `date` (optional), `description` (optional), `categoryId` (optional).
    *   Response: `200 OK` with updated transaction object.
*   **DELETE /api/v1/transactions/{id}** — Delete a transaction.
    *   Parameters: `id` (path), `userId` (auth token).
    *   Response: `204 No Content`.
*   **GET /api/v1/categories** — Retrieve a list of categories for the authenticated user.
    *   Parameters: `userId` (auth token).
    *   Response: `200 OK` with an array of category objects.
*   **POST /api/v1/categories** — Create a new category.
    *   Parameters: `userId` (auth token), `name`, `type`.
    *   Response: `201 Created` with new category ID.
*   **GET /api/v1/dashboard/summary** — Retrieve aggregated spending data for dashboard charts.
    *   Parameters: `userId` (auth token), `startDate`, `endDate`, `groupBy` (e.g., `category`, `month`).
    *   Response: `200 OK` with aggregated data suitable for Chart.js.

### API Contracts
*   **Request Schema (Transaction Creation/Update)**:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "amount": { "type": "number", "minimum": 0.01 },
        "type": { "type": "string", "enum": ["income", "expense"] },
        "date": { "type": "string", "format": "date" },
        "description": { "type": "string", "maxLength": 255 },
        "categoryId": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^[0-9a-fA-F]{24}$" }
      },
      "required": ["amount", "type", "date", "categoryId"]
    }
    ```
*   **Response Schema (Transaction)**:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^[0-9a-fA-F]{24}$" },
        "userId": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^[0-9a-fA-F]{24}$" },
        "amount": { "type": "number" },
        "type": { "type": "string" },
        "date": { "type": "string", "format": "date" },
        "description": { "type": "string" },
        "categoryId": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^[0-9a-fA-F]{24}$" },
        "categoryName": { "type": "string" }
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Error Schema**:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "code": { "type": "string" },
        "message": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["code", "message"]
    }
    ```
*   **Validation Rules**:
    *   `amount` must be a positive number.
    *   `type` must be either "income" or "expense".
    *   `date` must be a valid date format.
    *   `categoryId` must be a valid ID referencing an existing category for the user.
    *   All string fields must be trimmed and sanitized to prevent XSS.

### API Versioning Strategy
*   **Versioning Method**: URL path versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`). This is clear and widely understood.
*   **Version Lifecycle**: Each major version (e.g., v1, v2) will have a minimum 12-month support window from its release. Deprecation will be announced 3 months in advance, with a further 3 months before sunset.
*   **Backward Compatibility**: Aim for backward compatibility within minor versions. Breaking changes will necessitate a new major version.
*   **Migration Strategy**: Provide clear documentation and migration guides for clients upgrading to new API versions. Offer tooling or scripts where feasible to assist with migrations.

### API Testing Strategy
*   **Contract Testing**: Automatically generate tests from the OpenAPI specification using tools like Dredd or Pact to ensure API adherence to defined contracts.
*   **Integration Testing**: Implement end-to-end tests for all critical API flows (e.g., creating a transaction, fetching dashboard summary) using real database dependencies.
*   **Performance Testing**: Conduct load testing using tools like JMeter or k6 to ensure API endpoints meet specified performance requirements under expected and peak loads.
*   **Security Testing**: Include tests for authentication, authorization, input validation (OWASP Top 10), and rate limiting to prevent common vulnerabilities.

*   **Simplicity Gate**: The feature "Personal Finance Dashboard" can be implemented with a single frontend project (React/TypeScript/Tailwind/Chart.js) and a single backend project (e.g., Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL). This satisfies the "≤ 5 projects" simplicity gate.
*   **Library-First Gate**: Every feature starts as a standalone library. UI/app layers are thin veneers over libraries
*   **Test-First Gate**: The development will adhere to a strict Test-First approach:
    1.  **Contract**: Define API contracts (OpenAPI spec) and derive tests.
    2.  **Integration**: Write integration tests for API endpoints interacting with the database.
    3.  **E2E**: Develop end-to-end tests for critical user flows on the dashboard.
    4.  **Unit**: Write unit tests for individual frontend components and backend services.
    5.  **Implementation**: Develop code to pass the tests.
    6.  **UI-API Integration**: Verify frontend and backend communicate correctly through UI tests.
*   **Integration-First Testing Gate**: Integration tests will primarily use a real PostgreSQL database instance (either local or test environment) to ensure accurate behavior with actual data. Mocks will be used sparingly for external services (e.g., payment gateways, if introduced later) and will require written justification in the test suite documentation.
*   **Anti-Abstraction Gate**: The system will employ a single domain model for financial transactions and categories, avoiding excessive abstraction layers like DTOs, Repositories, or Units of Work unless a clear and compelling necessity arises (e.g., supporting multiple database types in the future).
*   **Traceability Gate**: All functional requirements (FR-XXX) will be explicitly traced to corresponding tests and code implementations. This will be enforced through code comments, commit messages, and potentially automated checks in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Performance Gate**: Performance will be prioritized with targets of <3 seconds load time for the initial dashboard view and <100 milliseconds for user interactions (e.g., filtering data, navigating categories). Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) will be monitored and optimized using techniques such as lazy loading, code splitting, image optimization, and efficient data fetching.
*   **Accessibility Gate**: The dashboard will aim for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. This includes:
    *   **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements will be accessible and operable via keyboard.
    *   **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes will be used to provide meaningful context for screen readers.
    *   **Color Contrast**: Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and interactive elements.
    *   **Focus Management**: Clear visual focus indicators for keyboard users.
*   **Security Gate**: Robust web security measures will be implemented:
    *   **HTTPS**: All communication will be encrypted using HTTPS.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a strict CSP to mitigate XSS attacks.
    *   **XSS/CSRF Protection**: Employ proper input sanitization, output encoding, and CSRF tokens.
    *   **Secure Headers**: Utilize security-related HTTP headers (e.g., HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options).
    *   **Authentication/Authorization**: Implement secure user authentication (e.g., JWTs) and role-based authorization for API endpoints.
    *   **Input Validation**: Strict server-side validation for all user inputs.
*   **Progressive Enhancement Gate**: The dashboard will be designed to offer basic functionality (e.g., displaying static data, core navigation) even if JavaScript fails or is disabled, using server-side rendering or graceful degradation techniques. Rich interactive features and dynamic charts will then enhance this base experience when JavaScript is available.
*   **Responsive Design Gate**: The design will be mobile-first, ensuring optimal usability and aesthetics on small screens. Media queries and Tailwind CSS will be used to define breakpoints and adapt the layout and component sizing for tablet and desktop views, ensuring a seamless experience across all screen sizes.
*   **Browser Compatibility Gate**: The dashboard will be tested and ensured to function correctly on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, aiming for 95% browser coverage of the target user base. Polyfills will be used as necessary for older browser features.
*   **API-First Gate**: The project will strictly follow an API-First approach. Web-optimized APIs will be designed, documented (via OpenAPI), and implemented before the UI. This ensures a clear contract between frontend and backend, supports multiple potential clients, and enables independent development. RESTful principles, JSON responses, and proper CORS support will be foundational. Progressive enhancement fallbacks will be considered for scenarios where API responses might be delayed or unavailable.
