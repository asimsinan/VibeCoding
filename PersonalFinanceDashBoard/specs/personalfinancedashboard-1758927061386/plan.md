## Metadata
*   **Feature Branch**: feat/personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386
*   **Created**: 2025-09-26
*   **Status**: Draft
*   **Platform**: web
*   **Spec Path**: specs/personalfinancedashboard-1758927061386/spec.md

## Summary
The Personal Finance Dashboard will enable users to track and visualize their spending across various categories using a web application built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js. The primary requirement is to provide clear insights into financial habits through interactive charts and categorized transaction tracking.

## Technical Context
*   **Language/Version**: TypeScript 4.x, Node.js 18.x (for backend), React 18.x
*   **Primary Dependencies**:
    *   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, React Router, Axios
    *   **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL client (e.g., `pg`), dotenv, bcrypt (for password hashing), jsonwebtoken (for JWTs)
*   **Storage**: PostgreSQL for relational transaction and category data.
*   **Testing**: Jest/React Testing Library for frontend unit/integration tests, Supertest for backend API integration tests, Cypress for E2E tests, OpenAPI contract testing tools.
*   **Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **Performance Goals**:
    *   Initial dashboard load time: <3 seconds.
    *   Interactive chart updates/filtering: <100 milliseconds.
    *   API response times for data retrieval: <100 milliseconds.
    *   Efficient data aggregation for large transaction sets.

## Constitution Check

### Simplicity Gate
*   **Projects**: 2 (one frontend application, one backend API service). This meets the "≤ 5 projects" requirement.
*   **Max Projects**: 5
*   **Using Framework Directly**: Yes
*   **Single Data Model**: Yes
*   **Instruction**: Validate ≤5 projects for initial scope. If exceeded, force simplification or document in Complexity Tracking.

### Architecture Gate
*   **Every Feature As Library**: The core business logic for financial tracking and categorization will be encapsulated within a library (e.g., `lib/finance-tracker/`) that the frontend and backend interact with.
*   **CLI Per Library Planned**: A CLI interface will be planned for the backend library to manage categories, import/export transactions (e.g., for administrative tasks or data migration), and run data analysis.
*   **Libraries**: `lib/finance-tracker/` (core logic), `lib/auth/` (user authentication and authorization).
*   **Instruction**: Ensure every feature starts as standalone library with CLI interface. UI/app layers are thin veneers.

### Testing Gate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
*   **TDD Order Enforced**: Yes, strict TDD will be followed: Contract → Integration → E2E → Unit → Implementation → UI-API Integration.
*   **Real Dependencies Used**: Yes, integration tests will utilize a real PostgreSQL database instance. Mocks will be justified for external services if introduced later.
*   **Contract Tests Planned**: Yes, contract tests will be generated from the OpenAPI specification to ensure API adherence.
*   **Instruction**: Enforce TDD order: Contract → Integration → E2E → Unit → Implementation → UI-API Integration. Prefer real dependencies over mocks.

### Platform-Specific Gates
*   **Content**:
    *   **Progressive Enhancement**: The dashboard will function with basic HTML and CSS, then enhance with JavaScript for interactive charts and dynamic content.
    *   **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design principles will be applied, with Tailwind CSS utility classes and media queries for adaptive layouts across various screen sizes.
    *   **Browser Compatibility**: Thorough testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge will ensure compatibility, targeting 95% browser coverage.
    *   **Performance Optimization**: Strategies include lazy loading components, code splitting, image optimization, efficient API calls, and optimized Chart.js configurations to meet Core Web Vitals.
    *   **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance will be targeted, including semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and adequate color contrast.
    *   **Security**: HTTPS, robust authentication (JWT), input validation, CSP, and XSS/CSRF protection will be implemented for web security.
    *   **API-First**: The API will be designed and documented using OpenAPI before frontend implementation begins, ensuring clear contracts and enabling parallel development.
*   **Instruction**: Validate platform-specific gates based on selected platform. Include API-First for web/mobile/backend platforms.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Contracts & Tests (Estimated: 0.5 days / 4 hours AI assisted)
1.  **Define API Contracts**: Finalize OpenAPI 3.0 specification (`contracts/openapi.yaml`) for all transaction, category, and dashboard summary endpoints.
2.  **Generate Data Models**: Create TypeScript interfaces/types from the finalized API contracts for both frontend and backend.
3.  **Contract Tests (Failing)**: Write initial contract tests based on the OpenAPI specification using a tool like Dredd or custom scripts to ensure API adherence. These tests will initially fail.
4.  **Integration Test Scenarios**: Outline integration test scenarios for backend API endpoints, focusing on database interactions (CRUD for transactions and categories, data aggregation for summary). These tests will initially fail.
5.  **E2E Test Scenarios**: Define high-level end-to-end user flows (e.g., adding a transaction, viewing the dashboard, filtering data) for Cypress. These tests will initially fail.

### Phase 2: Library Implementation (Estimated: 1 day / 8 hours AI assisted)
1.  **Backend Data Layer**: Implement PostgreSQL database schema, migrations, and data access logic within `lib/finance-tracker/services/` (e.g., `TransactionService`, `CategoryService`).
2.  **Backend API Logic**: Implement controller logic in `api/controllers/` to handle API requests, interact with `lib/finance-tracker/`, and manage user authentication via `lib/auth/`.
3.  **CLI Interface for Backend Library**: Develop `lib/finance-tracker/cli.ts` for managing categories and potentially importing initial data.
4.  **Frontend Core Components**: Develop foundational React components (`web/components/`) for layout, navigation, and data display.
5.  **Frontend Data Fetching**: Implement data fetching logic using Axios to interact with the backend API.
6.  **Pass Tests**: Implement minimal code to make contract, integration, and unit tests pass.

### Phase 3: Integration & Validation (Estimated: 0.5 days / 4 hours AI assisted)
1.  **Frontend Dashboard UI**: Implement dashboard pages (`web/pages/Dashboard.tsx`) with Chart.js visualizations for spending categories and trends.
2.  **Frontend Transaction/Category Management**: Develop UI for adding, editing, and deleting transactions and categories.
3.  **UI-API Integration Tests**: Implement tests that verify correct data flow and interaction between the frontend UI and backend API.
4.  **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize frontend rendering and backend queries to meet performance goals (<3s load, <100ms interaction).
5.  **Security Review**: Conduct a security review, focusing on input validation, authentication, authorization, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
6.  **Documentation Updates**: Update API documentation, READMEs, and add usage examples.

## Database Strategy

### Database Technology Choice
PostgreSQL will be used as the primary database due to its reliability, ACID compliance, and advanced querying capabilities suitable for financial data.

### Schema Design Planning
*   `users` table: `id` (PK), `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `created_at`.
*   `categories` table: `id` (PK), `user_id` (FK to users), `name`, `type` (`income`/`expense`), `created_at`.
*   `transactions` table: `id` (PK), `user_id` (FK to users), `amount`, `type` (`income`/`expense`), `date`, `description`, `category_id` (FK to categories), `created_at`.
*   Indexes on `user_id`, `category_id`, and `date` in the `transactions` table for efficient querying.
*   Normalization to 3NF.

### Migration Strategy
Database schema changes will be managed using a migration tool (e.g., Flyway or Knex.js migrations) to ensure version control, safe rollbacks, and consistent schema evolution across environments.

### Connection Management
Connection pooling (e.g., using `pg-pool` for Node.js) will be implemented on the backend to efficiently manage database connections, handle timeouts, and implement retry logic for transient connection errors.

## API-First Planning (Web/Mobile/Backend)

### API Design Planning
RESTful API design with clear resource-oriented endpoints (`/transactions`, `/categories`, `/dashboard/summary`). Consistent use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### API Contract Planning
OpenAPI 3.0 specification will serve as the single source of truth for API contracts, defining request/response schemas, data types, validation rules, and error handling.

### API Testing Planning
Contract testing with Dredd, comprehensive integration tests with Supertest, and performance testing with k6.

### API Documentation Planning
OpenAPI specification will be used to generate interactive API documentation (e.g., with Swagger UI), which will include detailed examples, versioning information, and migration guides.

## Platform-Specific Planning

### Web Platform Planning
*   **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement core content and navigation with server-side rendering or static site generation (if feasible) to provide a baseline experience without JavaScript. Enhance with React for interactivity and Chart.js visualizations.
*   **Responsive Design**: Adopt a mobile-first approach. Use Tailwind CSS for flexible layouts and responsive utility classes. Design specific breakpoints for small, medium, and large screens to ensure optimal viewing.
*   **Browser Compatibility**: Test and ensure full functionality on the latest two major versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Utilize PostCSS and Babel for cross-browser CSS and JavaScript compatibility.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading for routes and components. Optimize image assets. Use efficient data fetching strategies (e.g., React Query). Minimize bundle sizes through tree-shaking. Optimize Chart.js rendering for large datasets. Monitor Core Web Vitals.
*   **Accessibility**: Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. Use semantic HTML5 elements. Provide clear `alt` text for images. Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable with visible focus states. Implement ARIA attributes where standard HTML is insufficient.

## Complexity Tracking
*   **Description**: Use only when a constitutional gate is intentionally broken
*   **Table**:
    | Violation | Justification | Simpler Alternative Rejected |
