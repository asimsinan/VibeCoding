# Feature Specification: PersonalShoppingAssistant

## Metadata
- **Created**: 2025-09-29
- **Status**: Draft
- **Platform**: Web
- **Input**: Create a virtual personal shopping assistant that suggests products based on user preferences, using React, TypeScript, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL, and a simple recommendation algorithm

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a busy shopper, I want a personalized shopping assistant that learns my preferences and suggests relevant products, so I can discover items I'll love without spending time browsing through irrelevant options.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new user visits the shopping assistant, **When** they complete their preference profile, **Then** the system should provide personalized product recommendations based on their stated preferences.

2. **Given** a returning user with existing preferences, **When** they browse recommended products, **Then** the system should display products ranked by relevance to their profile and past interactions.

3. **Given** a user interacts with recommended products (views, likes, purchases), **When** they return to the assistant, **Then** the system should update their preferences and provide improved recommendations.

4. **Given** a user searches for a specific product category, **When** they submit their search, **Then** the system should return both search results and additional personalized recommendations in that category.

5. **Given** a user has no interaction history, **When** they request recommendations, **Then** the system should provide popular products in their preferred categories with clear indicators that these are general recommendations.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has conflicting preferences (e.g., likes both luxury and budget items)?
- How does the system handle users who never interact with recommendations?
- What occurs when the product database is empty or has very few items in a user's preferred categories?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create and manage personal preference profiles including categories, price ranges, brands, and style preferences
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement a recommendation algorithm that suggests products based on user preferences and interaction history
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to view, like, dislike, and purchase recommended products through the interface
- **FR-004**: System MUST track user interactions (views, likes, purchases) to improve future recommendations
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide search functionality with both direct search results and personalized recommendations
- **FR-006**: System MUST display product information including images, descriptions, prices, and availability
- **FR-007**: System MUST support user authentication and profile management

### Key Entities

- **User** — Represents a shopping assistant user with preferences, interaction history, and authentication data
- **Product** — Represents items in the catalog with attributes like name, description, price, category, brand, and availability
- **Preference** — Represents user's shopping preferences including categories, price ranges, brands, and style preferences
- **Interaction** — Represents user actions on products (view, like, dislike, purchase) with timestamps for recommendation learning

### Database Requirements

- **Database Type**: PostgreSQL (Relational database for structured data with ACID compliance)
- **Data Volume**: Expected 10,000+ products, 1,000+ users, 100,000+ interactions
- **Performance**: <200ms response time for recommendations, <100ms for product searches
- **Consistency**: ACID compliance for user data and transaction integrity
- **Security**: Encrypted passwords, secure API endpoints, user data privacy protection
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling support for user growth and product catalog expansion
- **Backup/Recovery**: Daily automated backups with 4-hour RTO and 1-hour RPO

### Technology Stack Requirements

### API Versioning Strategy

- **Versioning Method**: URL path versioning (/api/v1/, /api/v2/)
- **Version Lifecycle**: Major versions supported for 2 years, minor versions for 6 months
- **Backward Compatibility**: Non-breaking changes only in minor versions, breaking changes require major version bump
- **Migration Strategy**: Gradual migration with deprecation warnings, client SDK updates, and documentation

### API Testing Strategy

- **Contract Testing**: Generated tests from OpenAPI specification using tools like Dredd or Pact
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end API testing with real database and external services
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for recommendation endpoints with 1000+ concurrent users
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, input validation, and SQL injection testing
