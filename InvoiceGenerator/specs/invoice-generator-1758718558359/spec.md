# Feature Specification: Invoice Generator

## Metadata
- **Feature Branch**: feat/invoice-generator-1758718558359
- **Created**: 2025-09-24
- **Status**: Draft
- **Input**: Build an invoice generator that lets users enter client details and items and download as PDF, using React, CSS, and jsPDF
- **Platform**: web

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Story
As a business owner or freelancer, I want to create professional invoices quickly and easily so that I can bill my clients and get paid faster. I need to enter client information, add line items with descriptions and prices, calculate totals automatically, and download the invoice as a PDF that I can send to my clients.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am on the invoice generator page, **When** I enter client details (name, address, email) and add items with descriptions and prices, **Then** the system should calculate subtotal, tax, and total automatically and display a preview of the invoice.

2. **Given** I have filled out a complete invoice with client details and items, **When** I click the "Download PDF" button, **Then** the system should generate a professional PDF invoice and download it to my device.

3. **Given** I am creating an invoice, **When** I add multiple line items with different quantities and prices, **Then** the system should calculate the correct line totals and overall invoice total.

4. **Given** I have an incomplete invoice (missing required fields), **When** I try to download the PDF, **Then** the system should show validation errors and prevent PDF generation until all required fields are filled.

5. **Given** I am editing an invoice, **When** I modify item quantities or prices, **Then** the system should recalculate all totals in real-time.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user enters very long client names or item descriptions that exceed typical display widths?
- How does the system handle decimal prices with many decimal places (e.g., $123.999999)?
- What happens when a user tries to download a PDF with zero items or empty invoice?
- How does the system handle special characters in client names or item descriptions that might affect PDF generation?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a form interface for entering client details including name, address, email, and phone number
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to add, edit, and remove line items with description, quantity, unit price, and calculated line total
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to set tax rate and have the system automatically calculate tax amount and total
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate a professional PDF invoice using jsPDF library with proper formatting and layout
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate required fields and prevent PDF generation until all mandatory information is provided
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide real-time calculation of subtotals, tax, and total amounts as user enters data
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to preview the invoice before downloading as PDF

## Key Entities

- **Invoice** — Main document containing client information, line items, totals, and metadata (invoice number, date, due date)
- **Client** — Customer information including name, address, contact details, and billing information
- **LineItem** — Individual invoice line with description, quantity, unit price, and calculated total
- **InvoiceTotals** — Calculated amounts including subtotal, tax amount, and final total

## API Specification (API-First Approach)

### API Endpoints

### API Versioning Strategy

- **Versioning Method**: URL path versioning (/api/v1/, /api/v2/)
- **Version Lifecycle**: 
  - v1: Current stable version
  - v2: Planned for advanced features (templates, recurring invoices)
  - Deprecation: 6 months notice before version sunset
- **Backward Compatibility**: Non-breaking changes only within major versions
- **Migration Strategy**: Client libraries with automatic version detection and migration tools

### API Testing Strategy

- **Contract Testing**: Generated tests from OpenAPI spec using Dredd or similar tools
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end API testing with real PDF generation
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for PDF generation under concurrent users
- **Security Testing**: Input validation, XSS prevention, and rate limiting

## Constitutional Gates

### Simplicity Gate
**Check**: This feature can be implemented with ≤5 projects:
1. Core invoice library (business logic)
2. React UI components
3. PDF generation service
4. API layer
5. Integration tests

✅ **PASSED** - Feature scope is well-contained and can be implemented with 5 or fewer projects.

### Library-First Gate
**Check**: Feature starts as standalone library with thin UI veneer:
- Core invoice calculation and validation logic in standalone library
- PDF generation as separate service module
- React components as thin UI layer over library functions
- CLI interface for library usage

✅ **PASSED** - Architecture planned with core library and thin UI layer.

### Test-First Gate
**Check**: Implementation sequence planned as Contract → Integration → E2E → Unit → Implementation:
- Contract tests from OpenAPI specification
- Integration tests for PDF generation
- E2E tests for complete user workflows
- Unit tests for business logic
- Implementation follows Red → Green → Refactor

✅ **PASSED** - Test-first approach planned with proper sequence.

### Integration-First Testing Gate
**Check**: Real dependencies preferred over mocks:
- Real jsPDF library for PDF generation testing
- Real browser APIs for file download testing
- Real React components for UI testing
- Mocks only for external services (if any)

✅ **PASSED** - Integration-first testing planned with real dependencies.

### Anti-Abstraction Gate
**Check**: Single domain model approach:
- Invoice as primary domain model
- No unnecessary DTO/Repository/Unit-of-Work patterns
- Direct data flow from UI to PDF generation
- Simple state management

✅ **PASSED** - Single domain model approach planned.

### Traceability Gate
**Check**: Every line of code traces to numbered requirements:
- FR-001 → Client form components
- FR-002 → Line item management
- FR-003 → Tax calculation logic
- FR-004 → PDF generation service
- FR-005 → Form validation
- FR-006 → Real-time calculation
- FR-007 → Invoice preview

✅ **PASSED** - Full traceability planned from requirements to implementation.

### Progressive Enhancement Gate
**Check**: Works without JavaScript, then enhances:
- Basic HTML form works for data entry
- CSS-only styling for basic layout
- JavaScript enhances with real-time calculations
- PDF generation requires JavaScript (graceful degradation message)

✅ **PASSED** - Progressive enhancement approach planned.

### Responsive Design Gate
**Check**: Mobile-first design with all screen sizes:
- Mobile-first CSS approach
- Breakpoints for tablet (768px) and desktop (1024px)
- Touch-friendly form controls
- Responsive PDF preview

✅ **PASSED** - Responsive design planned for all screen sizes.

### Performance Gate
**Check**: Web performance requirements:
- <3s initial page load
- <100ms interaction response
- Core Web Vitals compliance
- Optimized PDF generation

✅ **PASSED** - Performance requirements defined and achievable.

### Accessibility Gate
**Check**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance:
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance
- Form labels and error messages
- Focus management

✅ **PASSED** - Full accessibility compliance planned.

### Security Gate
**Check**: Web security implementation:
- HTTPS enforcement
- Content Security Policy
- XSS and CSRF protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure headers

✅ **PASSED** - Comprehensive security measures planned.

### Browser Compatibility Gate
**Check**: Cross-browser support:
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge support
- 95% of target browsers supported
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Feature detection for PDF generation

✅ **PASSED** - Cross-browser compatibility planned.

### API-First Gate
**Check**: Web-optimized APIs:
- RESTful endpoints for invoice operations
- JSON request/response format
- CORS support for cross-origin requests
- Progressive enhancement fallbacks

✅ **PASSED** - API-first approach with web optimization planned.

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional gate violations - complexity tracking not needed*

## SDD Principles
- **Intent Before Mechanism**: Focus on WHAT and WHY before HOW
- **Multi-Step Refinement**: Use iterative refinement over one-shot generation
- **Library-First Testing**: Prefer real dependencies over mocks
- **CLI Interface Mandate**: Every capability has CLI with --json mode
- **Traceability**: Every line of code traces to numbered requirement
- **Business-Facing**: Specifications are for non-technical stakeholders

## Notes for Cursor
- Use absolute file paths when creating under specs/
- Use Cursor's Git UI for branch creation feat/invoice-generator-1758718558359
- When Git isn't initialized, annotate steps and continue; avoid shell-only workflows
- Reference spec requirements in code reviews; refuse implementation tasks lacking prior tests
