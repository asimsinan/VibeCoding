│   ├── TimeSlotService.js        # Time slot management
│   ├── CalendarService.js        # Calendar view generation
│   └── ConflictService.js        # Conflict detection and prevention
├── repositories/
│   ├── AppointmentRepository.js  # Data access layer

## Next Phase Preview

Phase 5 will focus on Application Integration, building the Express.js API layer that uses the appointment-core library. This phase will:
- Create the main application server
- Implement API routes using the core library
- Add middleware for authentication and error handling
- Create comprehensive end-to-end tests with Playwright

The core library from Phase 4 will serve as the foundation for the application layer, ensuring clean separation of concerns and maintainable architecture.
