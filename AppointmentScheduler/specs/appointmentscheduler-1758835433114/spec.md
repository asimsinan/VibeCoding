# Feature Specification: AppointmentScheduler

## Metadata
- **Feature Branch**: feat/appointmentscheduler-1758835433114
- **Created**: 2025-09-25
- **Status**: Draft
- **Input**: Create an appointment scheduler with a calendar view and booking slots, using React, Tailwind CSS, and date-handling library like date-fns
- **Platform**: Web

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to view available appointment slots in a calendar interface and book appointments so that I can schedule meetings, consultations, or services at convenient times without conflicts.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user opens the appointment scheduler, **When** they view the calendar interface, **Then** they should see available time slots clearly marked and unavailable slots grayed out.

2. **Given** a user sees available appointment slots, **When** they click on a specific time slot, **Then** they should be able to enter their details and confirm the booking.

3. **Given** a user has booked an appointment, **When** they return to the calendar, **Then** their booked slot should be marked as unavailable to other users.

4. **Given** a user wants to view different months, **When** they navigate using month controls, **Then** the calendar should update to show the selected month with appropriate available slots.

5. **Given** a user tries to book an already taken slot, **When** they attempt to confirm the booking, **Then** they should receive an error message and the slot should remain unavailable.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to book an appointment in the past?
- How does the system handle timezone differences for users in different locations?
- What occurs when multiple users try to book the same slot simultaneously?
- How does the system handle invalid time formats or malformed date inputs?
- What happens when the calendar needs to display a leap year or month with different numbers of days?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a monthly calendar view with clear visual indicators for available and unavailable appointment slots
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to navigate between different months and years using intuitive controls
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to click on available time slots to initiate the booking process
- **FR-004**: System MUST collect and validate user information (name, email, phone) during the booking process
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent double-booking by immediately marking slots as unavailable when booked
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide real-time updates when slots become available or unavailable
- **FR-007**: System MUST support different appointment durations (30 minutes, 1 hour, etc.) with appropriate slot sizing

### Key Entities

- **Appointment** — Represents a booked time slot with user details, start/end times, and status
- **TimeSlot** — Represents an available booking period with start time, duration, and availability status
- **Calendar** — Represents the monthly view containing time slots and navigation controls
- **User** — Represents the person booking an appointment with contact information

### Database Requirements

- **Database Type**: PostgreSQL for relational data with ACID compliance
- **Data Volume**: Expected 10,000+ appointments per month, growing at 20% annually
- **Performance**: <100ms response time for calendar queries, <50ms for slot availability checks
- **Consistency**: ACID compliance for booking operations to prevent double-booking
- **Security**: Encrypted storage of user data, secure authentication for admin functions
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with read replicas for calendar views
- **Backup/Recovery**: Daily automated backups with 4-hour RTO, 1-hour RPO

## API Specification (API-First Approach)

### API Endpoints

- **GET /api/v1/calendar/{year}/{month}** — Retrieve available time slots for a specific month, returns calendar data with slot availability
- **POST /api/v1/appointments** — Create a new appointment booking, requires user details and time slot selection
- **GET /api/v1/appointments/{id}** — Retrieve specific appointment details by ID
- **PUT /api/v1/appointments/{id}** — Update existing appointment details (admin only)
- **DELETE /api/v1/appointments/{id}** — Cancel an appointment booking
- **GET /api/v1/slots/availability** — Check real-time availability of specific time slots

### API Contracts

### API Versioning Strategy

- **Versioning Method**: URL path versioning (/api/v1/, /api/v2/)
- **Version Lifecycle**: Major versions supported for 2 years, minor versions for 6 months
- **Backward Compatibility**: Non-breaking changes in minor versions, breaking changes in major versions only
- **Migration Strategy**: Automated migration tools and deprecation warnings 6 months before version sunset

### API Testing Strategy

- **Contract Testing**: Generated tests from OpenAPI spec using Dredd or similar tools
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end API testing with real database and external services
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for 1000+ concurrent users, response time <100ms
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, input validation, and SQL injection testing

## Constitutional Gates Validation

### Simplicity Gate Check
✅ **PASSED**: The appointment scheduler can be implemented with ≤5 projects:
1. Core appointment library (business logic)
2. Calendar UI component library
3. Booking form component library
4. API service layer
5. Main application integration

### Library-First Gate Check
✅ **PASSED**: Feature starts as standalone libraries:
- Core appointment management library with pure business logic
- Calendar view library with date-fns integration
- Booking form library with validation
- Thin React UI layer as veneer over libraries

### Test-First Gate Check
✅ **PASSED**: Test sequence planned:
1. Contract tests (OpenAPI spec validation)
2. Integration tests (API + database)
3. E2E tests (full user workflows)
4. Unit tests (individual components)
5. Implementation (TDD approach)
6. UI-API integration tests

### Integration-First Testing Gate Check
✅ **PASSED**: Real dependencies preferred:
- Real PostgreSQL database for testing
- Real date-fns library for date operations
- Real React components for UI testing
- Mock only external services (email notifications) with written justification

### Anti-Abstraction Gate Check
✅ **PASSED**: Single domain model approach:
- One Appointment entity with all necessary properties
- Direct database access without Repository pattern
- Simple service layer without Unit of Work
- Avoid DTOs unless absolutely necessary for API contracts

### Traceability Gate Check
✅ **PASSED**: Full traceability planned:
- Every component maps to specific FR-XXX requirements
- Test cases reference requirement numbers
- Code comments include requirement references
- Implementation follows requirement numbering

### Performance Gate Check
✅ **PASSED**: Web performance requirements:
- <3s initial page load time
- <100ms interaction response time
- Optimized calendar rendering with virtualization
- Lazy loading for large date ranges
- Core Web Vitals compliance

### Accessibility Gate Check
✅ **PASSED**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance:
- Keyboard navigation for all calendar interactions
- Screen reader support with proper ARIA labels
- Color contrast ratio ≥4.5:1
- Focus management and visible focus indicators
- Alternative text for visual elements

### Security Gate Check
✅ **PASSED**: Web security implementation:
- HTTPS enforcement for all communications
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- XSS protection with input sanitization
- CSRF protection with token validation
- Secure headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options)

### Progressive Enhancement Gate Check
✅ **PASSED**: Graceful degradation:
- Basic calendar view works without JavaScript
- Form submission works with standard HTML forms
- JavaScript enhances with real-time updates
- Fallback to server-side rendering if needed

### Responsive Design Gate Check
✅ **PASSED**: Mobile-first design:
- Breakpoints: mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), desktop (1024px+)
- Touch-friendly interface for mobile devices
- Responsive calendar grid layout
- Adaptive form layouts for different screen sizes

### Browser Compatibility Gate Check
✅ **PASSED**: Cross-browser support:
- Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- 95% of target browser market covered
- Polyfills for older browser features
- Progressive enhancement for modern features

### API-First Gate Check
✅ **PASSED**: Web-optimized APIs:
- RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- CORS support for cross-origin requests
- Progressive enhancement fallbacks
- OpenAPI documentation and versioning
